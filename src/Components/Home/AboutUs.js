                            Fantasy cricket is a strategy-based online sports game where players create a virtual team of
                            real cricketers playing in real matches worldwide. You earn points based on the performances of
                            these players in actual matches. In a fantasy cricket match, you can create a team by choosing
                            11 players where you can pick a maximum of 7 players from any one team, playing the real-life
                            match.
